        <h2>General Questions</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is PetAdoption?</h3>
            <p>PetAdoption is an online platform dedicated to helping animals find loving homes.
                We connect adopters with shelters and rescue organizations across the country to make adoption
                easy, safe, and accessible for everyone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I get started with adopting a pet?</h3>
            <p>Simply browse our available pets, click on any pet that interests you,
                and follow the steps to start the adoption process.
                You’ll be asked to complete an application form,
                and our team or the partnering shelter will reach out to guide you through the next steps.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Adoption Process</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is included in the adoption fee?</h3>
            <p>The adoption fee usually covers initial vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and a health checkup.
                Some shelters may also provide additional resources or items,
                such as a starter kit of food or a collar. Check the specific pet's listing for details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I meet the pet before deciding?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Most of our partner shelters encourage meet-and-greet sessions to ensure a
                good match between you and the pet. Once your application is reviewed,
                you’ll be able to schedule a visit with the shelter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I adopt if I live out of state?</h3>
            <p>Many shelters allow out-of-state adoptions, but transportation arrangements may vary.
                Please check with the specific shelter for their out-of-state policies,
                or contact us for assistance.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Fostering and Volunteering</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How can I become a foster parent?</h3>
            <p>Fostering is a wonderful way to help animals without a long-term commitment.
                You can start by filling out a foster application on our <a href="#">foster page</a>
                Once approved, we’ll help match you with a pet in need of a temporary home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are the requirements for fostering?</h3>
            <p>Requirements vary by shelter but typically include being at least 18 years old,
                having a safe environment for the pet, and committing to the foster period.
                Some pets may have additional needs, which will be communicated before placement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are there other ways I can help besides adoption or fostering?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! Volunteers play a crucial role in our mission.
                You can help by volunteering at shelters, promoting animals online, donating,
                or helping with transportation.
